Calculate the key properties of a gas-liquid separator, including the diameter and volume of the vessel, the hold-up time of the liquid within the vessel, and the gas velocity through the vessel. The calculations are based on ensuring effective phase separation under given flow conditions and physical properties of the involved fluids.

Theory and Calculations:

    1. Terminal Velocity: The terminal velocity of droplets is crucial to ensure that the droplet can settle
       and be separated from the gas phase. It is calculated based on the modified Stokes' law which considers
       the effect of droplet diameter, and density differences between phases, under the influence of gravity.

    2. Separator Sizing: The diameter of the separator is sized to ensure that the gas velocity is less than
       the terminal velocity of the droplets. This is to prevent entrainment of the liquid droplets with the
       exiting gas and is based on the premise that lower gas velocities promote better phase separation.

    3. Hold-up Time: The hold-up time reflects the residence time of the liquid within the separator and is
       based on an assumed 60% of the total volume being occupied by the liquid. This metric is useful for
       assessing the efficiency of the separation process.
       
    4. D_sphere: The choice of D_sphere is instrumental in defining the smallest size of liquid droplets
      targeted for separation. A smaller D_sphere value increases the separation's effectiveness but also demands
      more precise and potentially costly equipment because of increasing equipment diameter and volume. Smaller values indicate
      that smaller droplets are targeted for removal, implying more stringent separation requirements. Typically,
      for water-like liquids, a droplet diameter of 0.0001m is used. For more viscous liquids, a larger diameter may
      still ensure efficient and effective separation.
