This repository hosts a collection of Python functions tailored for designing and analyzing shell and tube heat exchangers and other related equipment in chemical processing. These functions simplify complex engineering calculations necessary for determining structural and operational specifications, such as tube count, shell diameter, baffle arrangement, and equipment weight.

**Features**

*Estimate Tube Number*
Calculates the required number of tubes to achieve a specific heat transfer area, taking into account the tube diameter and length.

*Calculate Baffle Spacing*
Determines the optimal number of baffles and their spacing inside a heat exchanger shell to enhance heat transfer efficiency, based on Kern's method.

*Calculate Shell Diameter*
Computes the minimum shell diameter for a given number of tubes, tube diameter, and pitch type, ensuring proper fit and function within design parameters.

*Calculate Shell and Tube Exchanger Weight*
Estimates the total weight of a shell and tube heat exchanger, considering all components including tubes, shell, and baffles. This function is critical for structural planning and logistics in plant design.
