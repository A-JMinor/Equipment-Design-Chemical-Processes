# Equipment-Design-Chemical-Processes

For the Design of Chemical Process Equipment based on the book Product and Process Design Principles by Seider, Seader, Lewin and Widagdo.

Therefore, I created functions which can be used to e.g. calculate the weight of a tower or shell and tube heat exchanger. Those weights are often required for Techno-Economic Assessments or Life Cycle Assessments
